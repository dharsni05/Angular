    Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother,<br>
     and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her <br>
     so well that she would never wear anything else. So she was always called Little Red Riding Hood.One day her mother said to her, <br>
     "Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak,<br>
      and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the<br>
       path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing. And when you go into her room, don't forget to say, <br>
       good-morning, and don't peep into every corner before you do it." I will take great care, said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, <br>
       and gave her hand on it. The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered<br>
        the wood, a wolf met her. Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him. <br>
